## Merge patches like you're a kernel maintainer
Kernel maintainers use the `git am` (apply-mail) command to get patches from a
mailing list. GitHub has extended this command in `hub` to work with PR urls.
This allows you to omit those nasty merge commits and update / prune files
where needed.
```sh
$ hub am -3 <pull-request-url>
```

## branching model
`git-flow` is probably the most popular branching technique out there. It's
also shit. There are many caveats in it, and it doesn't use some use git
primitives where it should. A successful branching model for simple projects is:
- master is the truth of all merges
- each feature gets their own branch on the contributor's fork
- whenever a feature is done, it's pulled in
- master gets a tag

It doesn't need to be complex to be efficient. If hotfixes need to be
performed, master can be rebased on top of that. If features need to be
removed, just request the commit range for certain tag to roll back. Tada!

## Git hooks
Git hooks are a way of extending git with functionality whenever things happen.
To some extent `npm` has a similar mechanism called `npm scripts`. Git hooks
are just regular bash scripts that are triggered on actions. They live in
`.git/hooks`, where the filename is the name of the hook. The following hooks
are available:
```txt
applypatch-msg
pre-applypatch
post-applypatch
pre-commit
prepare-commit-msg
commit-msg
post-commit
pre-rebase
post-checkout
post-merge
pre-receive
update
post-receive
post-update
pre-auto-gc
post-rewrite
pre-push
```

Git hook scripts cannot be checked into version control. If you want to persist
scripts between multiple users you must check them into the project itself and
then symlink them back in, preferably in a bootstrap script. Be careful when
running hard symlinks though, as they will overwrite any local files. Instead
create an aggregator script that moves the original scripts and then imports
the original + repo scripts back in.

Example functionality for git hooks includes: checking code style on commit,
running extended tests on rebase to master, verify that no commit is performed
while rebasing, semver is updated, etc.

## git bisect
Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug.

```sh
$ git bisect start master f596075   # git bisect <bad> <good>
$ git bisect good                   # mark a commit as good
$ git bisect bad                    # mark a commit as bad
$ git bisect reset                  # exit git bisect
$ git bisect run ./test             # run an auto script after git bisect start
```

## Manage main and fix commits
By running `--fixup` you can create fix commits for your main commit; this is a
better alternative to continuously rebasing on top of your previous commit.
With `--autosquash` the `--fixup` commits are automatically squashed into their
relevant commit.
```sh
$ git commit --fixup <commit-sha>   # automatically marks your commit as a fix
                                    # of a previous commit
$ git rebase -i --autosquash        # automatically organize merging of these
                                    # fixup commits and associated normal
                                    # commits
```

To create a temporary commit message of which the value can be discarded during
a rebase, prefix the message with `fixup! <commit>`.

To create a temporary commit message of which the value should be rolled back
into the original commit, prefix the message with `squash! <commit>`.

A best practice is to create a new empty commit, create a TODO list of the
scope of the commits and roll back all relevant commits into this commit using
`squash!` and `fixup!`.

## Unstage directory
```sh
$ git rm --cached -r dir
```

## Unstage file
```sh
$ git reset HEAD <file>
```

## Change remote to SSH
```sh
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
```

## Rebase the first 2 commits in git
The root commit is protected by default, the `--root` flag enables
modification:
```sh
$ git rebase -i --root
```

## Git blame
Sometimes you want to know who wrote a certain piece of code. `git blame` to
the rescue!
```sh
$ git blame <filename>                    # git blame a complete file
$ git blame -L <start>,<end> <filename>   # git blame between certain lines
```

## Safer force push
`--force` is dangerous as it blindly overwrites; `--force-with-lease` will
check if the ref hasn't been modified before force pushing.
```sh
$ git push --force-with-lease
```
- [atlassian/force-with-lease](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)

## Git get theirs / pull --force
```sh
$ git reset --hard origin
```

## Show staged files changes
```sh
$ git diff --cached
```

## Git stash pop conflicts
When `git stash pop` fails, the stash is not dropped, but changes are floating.
You can safely `git reset --hard` on top of this to unapply the stash since
it's kept in the stash list still.

## Safe git stash
- `git stash apply` - apply a git stash without destroying the stash

## Git fsck
Inspect individual objects in the DB.
- [git-fsck man page](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fsck.html)

## Git tags
```sh
git tag v1.0.0                   # create tag called 'v1.0.0'
git push --delete origin <tag>   # delete remote tag
git tag -d <tag>                 # delete local tag
```

## Git submodules
```sh
$ git submodules add <repo-name>
$ git submodule update --recursive
```
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

## Remote branches
```sh
$ git remote -vv                # display remote branches
$ git branch --unset-upstream   # remove tracking relationship with upstream
$ git push -u origin head       # push to current branchname on origin remote
```

## Show root commit
```sh
$ tag_commit="$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)"
```

## git branch status
```sh
$ git branch -vv
```

## create a new empty branch
Create a new branch that's detached from the history from the branch that it's
being forked off.
```sh
$ git checkout --orphan <branchname>
```

## stash files that haven't been checked in yet
```sh
$ git stash save -u
```
- http://melissakaulfuss.com/2016/04/18/git-and-how-to-survive-Part-I.html

## save stash with name
```sh
$ git stash save "<name>"
```

## Git worktree
Check out a branch into a directory
```sh
$ git worktree add <path> <branch>
```

## Force pull
From [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/force-git-to-overwrite-local-files-on-pull):
```sh
$ git fetch --all
$ git reset --hard origin/master
```

## Get current git branch
```sh
$ git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

## Fix refs errors
In case of `remote: fatal error in commit_refs`, run `git gc`
```sh
$ git gc
```

## Shortlog
```sh
$ git shortlog -n -s | head
```

## Generate a patch file
```sh
$ git diff <target-commit> --no-color > patch.diff
```

## Useful patch file
```sh
$ git diff --ignore-space-at-eol -b -w --ignore-blank-lines
```

## Change git timestamp

```sh
$ git commit --amend --date=" Wed Oct 07 22:05:44 2020 +0200"
```
