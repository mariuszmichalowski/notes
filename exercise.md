## 90 day bodyweight

Each workout split into two phases:

- conditioning: get tired doing bodyweight training.
- technique: can't rely on strength to carry, so got to learn proper technique.

Conditioning program:

1. No rest between exercises
2. Track reps

The way the program works:

- As many reps of the exercise listed
- Move onto the next exercise
- Work the list down

After 3 weeks there's an active rest week: recreational workout activities.
