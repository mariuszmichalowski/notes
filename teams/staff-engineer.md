## Promotion Packets

A promotion packet is a collection of achievements and accomplishments that
make a case for why you should be promoted. In order to be promoted you need
to build a case.

Where a "brag document" is an overview of things you have done, you can write
a promotional packet to also plan things that you may want to do.

### Brag document
- one per year
- 5-10 pages
- goals for this year
- goals for the next year
- projects
    - contributions to the project
    - impact of the project
- collaboration & mentorship
