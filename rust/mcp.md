            - Open a PR and go through the PR flow (FCP, etc.)
        - Idea is complex but approved and a lang team liaison volunteers
            - Open a rust-lang/lang-team PR with charter with project group
                - Revise as needed
            - FCP merge on PR by the lang team is approved

                    - Project group supports implementers
                    - Project group reviews and tests PRs

## Role of liaison

- Follow along on progress and inform the team.
- This may be a road to lang team membership.
- No decision making power.
- No requirement to get involved with the proposal itself.
